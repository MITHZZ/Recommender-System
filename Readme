Recommender-System
Implementation of Recommender system based on MovieLens Dataset

Deducing interpretations from your raw data is tricky and we need to succeed below scenarios: 1.Understand what the users’ needs are 2.Prioritise all matches

DataSet : We have got two types of dataset here ml-100k and 20m and each have different types of files (csv and compressed tar files). So I have tried to make it out for both dataset.

Basic Steps Invloved :

1)Choosing the dataset

2)Encoding your data: One-hot encoding Term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) encoding(Used Here) Word embeddings

Recommending content: Similarity-based Methods(Cosine Similarity Used here) One-class SVMs Matrix Factorisation Supervised Learning Deep Learning
4)Generating user preference profiles

As we know we have different types of filtering in the recommender system:

1.Content based : This algorithm recommends products which are similar to the ones that a user has liked in the past. 2.Collabrative based : This algorithm uses “User Behavior” for recommending items.

Here I have written three python code to implement recommender system:

Basic Recommender.ipnb(100k Datset Used) : Gives a top down list of most rated Movies
Collabrative.ipnb(100k Datset Used) : Gives the top list of movies rating based on the other movies liked by other user.
Contentbased.ipnb(20m Dataset Used) :
Formulas used: The formula used to calculate TF-IDF weight for term i in document j is:

w[i,j] = tf[i,j]*log(N/df[i])

Cosine Simialrity : the cosine of this angle computed as follows:

cos(x,y) = dot(x,y)/|x||y|

Euclidean distance :

Euc sqrt( (x1-x0)^2 + (y1-y0)^2 )

**Enchancement Required A content-based filtering model will not select items if the user’s previous behavior does not provide evidence for this. Acollaborative filtering cannot provide recommendations for new items if there are no user ratings upon which to base a prediction.

This can be resolved by combining collaborative and content-based filtering is to make predictions based on a weighted average of the content-based recommendations and the collaborative recommendations. 1.Combining item scores 2.Combining item ranks: Above is a Hybrid Recommeder System approach.
