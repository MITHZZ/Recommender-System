# Recommender-System
Implementation of Recommender system based on MovieLens Dataset

Deducing interpretations from your raw data is tricky and we need to succeed below scenarios:
1.Understand what the users’ needs are
2.Prioritise all matches

DataSet : We have got two types of dataset here ml-100k and 20k and each have different types of dataset (csv and compressed tar file). So I have tried to make it out for both dataset.


Basic Steps Invloved : 

1)Choosing the dataset

2)Encoding your data:
  One-hot encoding
  Term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) encoding(Used Here)
  Word embeddings 
  
3) Recommending content:
  Similarity-based Methods(Cosine Similarity Used here)
  One-class SVMs
  Matrix Factorisation
  Supervised Learning
  Deep Learning
  
4)Generating user preference profiles
